An <code>Overlay</code> is a low-level component that can be used to render any content
on top of the regular viewport. You probably won't need to use it directly; in most
cases a <code>Dialog</code> might be more appropriate.

```jsx
<Overlay>Hello from Cosmos!</Overlay>
```

Here's an example <code>Overlay</code>:
