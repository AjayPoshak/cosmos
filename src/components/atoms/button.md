## Examples

#### Buttons are great to ask users for action

```js
<Button>Save</Button>
```

#### Primary actions help attract attention to the main action

```js
<Button primary>Save</Button>
```

#### Use secondary actions for actions that are not as important

```js
<Button transparent>Iâ€™m transparent</Button>
```

#### Disable a button if you don't want the user isn't allowed to click on it

```js
<Button disabled>This one is disabled</Button>
```

#### Destructive buttons warn the user about it's effects. Proceed with caution.

```js
<Button destructive>Delete</Button>
```

#### Link button for linky stuff, idk?

```js
<Button link>Clear</Button>
```

#### Icon buttons work well in compact spaces

```js
<Button icon="copy" />
```
